"""A2 — emitter-wide certificate-sensitivity: Telperion certifying a meta-property
of its OWN emitters.

`nonvacuity.assert_certificate_sensitive` proves an emitted identity is
load-bearing (a corrupted certificate must break the claim).  Today only the WZ
emitter invokes it.  This meta-test makes the *stance* of every emitter explicit
and enforced: each of the ~42 emitters must be classified (identity-carrying →
CERTIFICATE_SENSITIVE, or positivity/decidable → STRUCTURALLY_NONVACUOUS) with a
rationale, so a newly-added emitter cannot silently ship unclassified.  It also
truthfully reports which CERTIFICATE_SENSITIVE emitters have their semantic check
actually WIRED vs. declared-but-unwired — naming the gap rather than papering it.

Stream B extends this gate with the NEGATIVE-CONTROL declaration: every emitter
must also declare whether it carries a Lean-backed generic negative control (an
adapter) or is not_applicable-with-a-reason, and every REGISTERED adapter must
pass the two-sided kernel control (forged FALSE rejected AND true twin compiles).
The Lean-backed half is guarded by `tests/lean_env.py::lean_env_ready` so it
skips cleanly in a fresh clone with no built mathlib.
