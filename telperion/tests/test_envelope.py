"""The F <= h(mu) envelope: mapped and shown non-inductive.

Pins: the empirical envelope peaks at exactly 1 at the tie, is < 1 elsewhere, the tie's children are the
extremizers -- AND the envelope is not a supersolution, so no single-variable h(mu) closes the induction.
A reasoned dead-end, not a proof. conjecture1_proved = False.
