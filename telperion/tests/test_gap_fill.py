"""Gap-driven emitter loop — sorry -> extract goal -> route-match -> fill.

The AXLE-inspired automation of the hand-driven BG round-trip: given a
``:= by sorry`` log-enclosure lemma, recover its ``(terms, q)`` and AUTO-SELECT
the certificate route.  These tests pin that the matcher + route-picker recover
EXACTLY the routes chosen by hand for the six real BG subaction enclosures, that
the ``+FSTAR`` (negative-coefficient) and negative-``q`` cases parse, that
``fill_gap`` emits a full theorem block, and that a non-enclosure gap is refused.
Kernel verification of the fills is offline here (needs a built Lean env); the
end-to-end fill->verify against the real ``R3Cert`` was exercised at build time.
conjecture1_proved = False.
