"""gap_budget_multiplicity emitter -- pruning a multiset optimisation by a tangent-price GAP
BUDGET, with every step checked by the Lean kernel.

conjecture1_proved = False.  Nothing in this module bears on the Riemann Hypothesis or on the
Brualdi-Goldwasser Laplacian-ratio problem: it certifies finite pruning consequences of one
elementary inequality per instance.  Downstream consumers state their own scope.

The dogfood is a classical instance.

THE SETTING
-----------
A configuration is a multiset ``m`` of integer-labelled atoms ``k`` from an alphabet
``[kmin, kmax]`` (or ``[kmin, oo)`` with a certified tail).  Its value is

    Phi(m) = sum_{k in m} w(k)  [ + c * log( sum_{k in m} y(k) / M ) ]

under a fixed linear normalisation ``sum_{k in m} ell(k) = M``.  The bracketed term is the
optional CONCAVE part; the only certified concave family is ``f(x) = c * log x`` with ``c >= 0``
(anything else is refused).  Its tangent at a rational ``x0 > 0`` with slope ``mu = c / x0``
gives ``f(x) <= f(x0) + mu (x - x0)``, and with the price ``tau``

    Phi(m) <= C - sum_{k in m} gamma(k),
    gamma(k) = tau * ell(k) - w(k) - (c / x0 / M) * y(k),
    C        = tau * M + c * log x0 - c.

(the separable case has ``c = 0``: ``gamma(k) = tau * ell(k) - w(k)``, ``C = tau * M``).  The
``gamma(k)`` are the per-atom GAPS.  A benchmark configuration ``bench`` with value ``B`` and
the same normalisation is given; any ``m`` with ``Phi(m) >= B`` then satisfies the BUDGET

    sum_{k in m} gamma(k) <= theta := C - B.

With every gap ``>= 0`` on the alphabet and rational lower bounds ``g_k <= gamma(k)``:

  (1) caps       ``count k <= floor(theta_hi / g_k)`` for every atom with ``g_k > 0``;
  (2) exclusion  ``count k = 0`` when ``g_k > theta_hi`` (the cap is 0), and, with a tail,
                 ``k < K0`` for every element when the tail bound exceeds ``theta_hi``;
  (3) knapsack   the vector of counts of the surviving positive-gap atoms lies in the
                 finite list of all vectors ``x <= caps`` with ``sum x_k g_k <= theta_hi``
                 (enumerated here, re-decided in the kernel by ``decide`` over naturals).

WHERE EACH NUMBER COMES FROM
----------------------------
* ``theta_hi`` -- an upper bound on ``theta``: exact when ``theta`` is rational, otherwise the
  stated upper end of an ``enclosure_tree`` certificate of ``theta`` (the log atoms are
  bracketed by Mathlib's ``Real.log_two_gt_d9`` / the Taylor estimate / the ``Real.log_mul``
  fold -- REUSED, not re-implemented), rounded UP to the grid ``1/D``.
* ``g_k`` -- a lower bound on ``gamma(k)``: exact when rational, else the stated lower end of
  an ``enclosure_tree`` certificate rounded DOWN to the grid.  A caller may CLAIM ``g_k`` /
  ``theta_hi``; the enclosure fold refuses any claim it does not imply.
* the tail -- for ``k >= K0`` the gap must have the shape
  ``gamma(k) = P k - c_t log(k + s) + d`` with ``c_t >= 0``; convexity (the same log tangent
  lemma, at ``K0 + s``) gives ``gamma(k) >= gamma(K0) + (P - c_t/(K0+s)) (k - K0)``, so the
  tail inherits ``g_{K0}`` once a rational ``P_lo <= P`` satisfies ``P_lo >= c_t/(K0+s)``.

THE LEAN (generic core, emitted once per file; instance files only instantiate it)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
``gapBudget_log_tangent`` (``Real.log_le_sub_one_of_pos`` at ``x / x0``),
``gapBudget_of_sep`` / ``gapBudget_of_concave`` (the budget from the model: multiset sums
``Multiset.sum_map_sub`` / ``sum_map_mul_left`` and the tangent step),
``gapBudget_count_mul_le`` (``count k * g_k <= theta``: split ``m`` by ``filter (. = k)``,
``Multiset.filter_eq'`` is a replicate, the rest is a sum of nonnegative gaps),
``gapBudget_nat_cap`` (the integer cap from ``theta < (cap + 1) g``), and
``gapBudget_knapsack`` (``sum_{k in A} count k * g_k <= theta`` through
``Finset.sum_multiset_map_count``).  Per instance: the model ``def``s, the enclosure theorems,
one gap lemma per listed atom, the tail lemma, the benchmark lemma
``Phi(bench) = B /\\ sum ell(bench) = M`` (so ``B`` is attained), and the main theorem.

HONEST SCOPE.  The main theorem is CONDITIONAL on ``Phi(m) >= B`` and the normalisation; it
prunes, it does not solve.  It says nothing about which surviving configuration is optimal,
nor about any problem the instance is not.  ``conjecture1_proved = False``.

ANTI-PHANTOM REFUSALS
---------------------
``gap_budget_multiplicity_certificate`` REFUSES (``GapBudgetRefusal``, a ``ValueError``):

* floats, bools, non-rational constants, functions other than the ``gb_log`` / ``gb_logk``
  atoms (``sp.log``/``exp`` are refused -- the log atoms carry their own domain checks)
* a concave part that is not ``("log", c >= 0)`` -- ``c < 0`` is CONVEX, the tangent inequality
  runs the wrong way; ``c = 0`` belongs to the separable model; ``x0 <= 0``; a non-rational or
  non-positive ``M``; ``y`` / ``ell`` that are not rational polynomials in ``k``
* a log argument ``<= 0`` at some atom (``Real.log`` is junk there), a ``gb_log`` argument
  ``<= 0``, ``= 1``, ``< 1/2`` or beyond the fold range
* a benchmark atom outside the alphabet, a negative or non-integral multiplicity, a benchmark
  whose normalisation is not ``M`` exactly, a benchmark mean ``<= 0``
* ``theta`` that depends on a parameter or on ``k`` (the budget must be uniform), a
  certified ``theta < 0`` (the benchmark would beat the tangent bound: inconsistent input)
* a gap that is negative, or not provably ``>= 0``, at some listed atom (the price does not
  dominate there: the budget argument needs every gap ``>= 0``)
* a claimed ``g_k`` / ``theta_hi`` the enclosure fold does not imply (the forge case)
* a tail whose gap is not ``P k - c_t log(k + s) + d`` with ``c_t >= 0``, ``K0 + s <= 0``, a
  slope ``P_lo < c_t / (K0 + s)`` (monotonicity not certified), a missing / stray tail start
* more than ``MAX_ATOMS`` listed atoms, a knapsack box above ``MAX_KNAPSACK_BOX`` points,
  a budget that prunes nothing, non-identifier names
