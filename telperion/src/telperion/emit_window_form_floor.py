"""Window-form-floor emitter -- Zhu's one-stroke window reduction as a certificate shape.

Xuefeng Zhu, arXiv:2608.24827 (v2, 2026-09-02), "Weil positivity in compact windows: a finite
reduction, certified two-sided bounds, and a Landau-Widom decay law", Theorem 1.1, proves: for
`L > 0` and `T#` with

    beta* := log(T# / 2pi) - 1/T# - A_L  >  0,       A_L = sum_{log n < 2L} 2 Lambda(n)/sqrt n,

if the leading `N x N` block of the reduced form `R` in the Legendre basis of `L^2[-L, L]`, cut
after `N` even modes with first discarded order `2N >~ e L T# / 2`, has `lambda_min >= lam0 > 0`,
then for every real even `f` with `supp f subset [-L, L]`

    Q(f)  >=  ( min(lam0, beta* - epsD) - epsB ) ||f||_2^2,

with `epsD` (tail-block deviation) and `epsB` (leading-tail coupling norm) explicit and
super-exponentially small.  Executed at `L = 0.8` (Theorem 1.2) this gives
`Q(f) >= 8.9e-18 ||f||_2^2`, i.e. unconditional Weil positivity on autocorrelation support `1.6`,
`2.3x` the classical `(log 2)/2` range of Yoshida and Connes-Consani.

THE SHAPE THAT HAD NO CERTIFICATE TYPE
--------------------------------------
Nothing in the registry lifts a FINITE certified block floor to a floor on an INFINITE-dimensional
form while carrying the lift's tail constants and the reduction's threshold constant explicitly:

  * ``weil_form_enclosure`` -- an Arb enclosure of `Re weilForm` for ONE explicit test function
    (or a `2 x 2` cross-correlation Gram block via Sylvester).  No uniform floor over a window,
    no `beta*`, no `A_L`, no tail constants.  Zhu's claim quantifies over EVERY `f` in `[-L, L]`.
  * ``interval_gram_inertia`` -- the exact signature `(p, q)` shared by every Hermitian matrix in a
    rational interval box.  Certifies INERTIA, not a quantitative floor, and explicitly REFUSES the
    definite case (`p == 0` or `q == 0`).  Zhu's block is definite and the datum is `lam0`.
  * ``psd_form`` -- exact rational PSD of one explicit matrix; no interval, no floor, no lift.
  * ``rayleigh_gram`` -- one Rayleigh direction, and it bounds `lambda_max` of a symmetric pencil
    from BELOW (`c'Jc - theta c'Ic > 0`).  That is the opposite end of the spectrum from the
    `lambda_min` floor this shape needs, and the opposite direction.
  * ``tight_cap_enclosure`` / ``bragg_floor`` -- unrelated shapes.

This emitter is that type.  Its certified datum is the bundle
`(L, T#, A_L, beta*, lam0, epsD, epsB, N)` closing on `min(lam0, beta* - epsD) - epsB > 0`.

THE DISCIPLINE (identical to ``emit_weil_form_enclosure``'s ``henc`` seam and the Li ladder)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`lam0`, `epsD` and `epsB` are multiprecision / interval-arithmetic outputs (Zhu uses mpmath with
the gmpy2 backend at 50 digits; this program's equivalent is Arb via python-flint).  The EMITTED
LEAN never asserts them.  The kernel proves only the finite rational inequality

    0 < min(lam0, beta* - epsD) - epsB

by `norm_num`, and the passage to a window floor runs through FOUR NAMED, UNDISCHARGED analytic
hypotheses, which are exactly the analytic content of Theorem 1.1 that this program does not have:

  * ``hQrep`` -- Zhu eq. (2), the frequency-side symbol representation
    `Q(f) = 2 F(i/2)^2 + (1/2pi) int |F|^2 Psi_L`.  A rearrangement of the PROVED node
    `RH_limit_explicit_formula`, but that rearrangement is not proved on main.
  * ``henv``  -- Zhu Lemma 3.1, the digamma envelope
    `Re psi(1/4 + it/2) - log pi >= log(t/2pi) - 1/t` for `t >= 15/4`, by Binet's second formula.
    Mathlib's digamma support does not reach it.
  * ``hloc``  -- Zhu eqs. (6) and (12), the Legendre / spherical-Bessel localization
    `|j_n(x)| <= x^n/(2n+1)!!` and the super-exponential decay it gives the `C`-matrix entries.
    Spherical Bessel functions are not in Mathlib.
  * ``hhead`` -- the Arb/mpmath TRUST SEAM: the leading block's least eigenvalue is at least `lam0`.

The two moves of Theorem 1.1 that ARE provable in Lean today -- the two-block bound (eq. 13,
`lambda_min(M_R) >= min(lambda_min(A), lambda_min(D)) - ||B||`) and the Cholesky residual bound
(Lemma 5.2, `lambda_min(M') >= -(r+s)` from `L~ L~^T >= 0` and Weyl) -- are recorded in the prelude
as the discharge targets.  They are not proved here; this emitter emits certificates, not analysis.

THE ANTI-PHANTOM FACE, AND WHY IT IS UNUSUALLY STRONG
------------------------------------------------------
``window_form_floor_certificate`` RE-DERIVES the two finite constants rather than trusting them:
`A_L` by exact von Mangoldt summation over `log n < 2L` (strict), and `beta*` from `(T#, A_L)`.
It refuses any instance whose declared values disagree beyond `const_tol`.

That is the guard that catches the paper's OWN RETRACTED CLAIM.  An earlier draft of Zhu's work
substituted the per-prime constant `A_eff = -sum_p min_theta sum_k c_{p,k} cos(k theta)` for `A_L`
in the envelope: at `L = 1.19`, `A_eff = 4.6948` against `A_L = 7.0750`.  `A_eff` bounds the comb
from BELOW, hence the symbol from ABOVE, and the envelope needs an UPPER bound for the comb; by
Lemma 3.2 (`sup_t P_L(t) = A_L` exactly, via Weyl equidistribution on `{log p}`) no pointwise upper
bound below `A_L` exists.  The resulting support-`2.38` claim is retracted (Remark 3.3, Section 15
item 4).  Every downstream number in that forgery is internally consistent -- with `A_eff` the
apparent threshold is `2 pi e^{A_eff} = 687.2` rather than the true `T_1 = 7427`, so a `T# = 1000`
run shows `beta* = 0.374 > 0` and a perfectly healthy-looking certificate.  ONLY re-derivation of
the constant from its definition catches it.  The negative-control twin is that forgery.

Full refusal list:
  * `L <= 0`, `T# <= 0`;
  * declared `A_L` disagrees with the recomputed comb mass -- THE RETRACTION GUARD;
  * declared `beta*` disagrees with `log(T#/2pi) - 1/T# - A_L`;
  * `beta* <= 0` -- Theorem 1.1's hypothesis fails; equivalently `T#` is below `T_1 = 2 pi e^{A_L}`
    (Theorem 1.4's barrier threshold, which Lemma 3.2 shows cannot be lowered);
  * `lam0 <= 0`, or negative `epsD` / `epsB`;
  * `2N < e L T# / 2` -- the Legendre localization does not apply at that cut, so the tail constants
    are not the ones bounded in the proof;
  * `min(lam0, beta* - epsD) - epsB <= 0` -- no positive floor is implied, so nothing is emitted.

WHAT THIS CERTIFIES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT (read before citing it)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Certified: a finite, kernel-checkable rational inequality, plus the bookkeeping that the constants
in it are the ones their definitions produce.  Category-(b): finite, consistent with RH, PROVING
NOTHING about RH.  Positivity of the Weil form on a bounded window is what RH predicts; observing it
on one window confirms nothing, since Weil positivity over EVERY support is RH-equivalent.

And the route is CLOSED, provably, by the same paper.  Theorem 1.4: any application of Theorem 1.1
needs `T# > T_1(L) = 2 pi e^{A_L}` with `A_L = (4 + o(1)) e^L` by PNT, so `T_1 = 2 pi exp(4 e^L)` and
the matrix size `N ~ L T_1` grows DOUBLY EXPONENTIALLY in the support; by Lemma 3.2 the threshold
cannot be lowered within pointwise-envelope certificates.  Certifying past support `~ 3.2`
(`T_1 ~ 1e7`) is, in the paper's word, computationally void.  Meanwhile the margin to be resolved
collapses at the Landau-Widom rate `-ln lambda*(L) ~ 2 pi^2 N(T*)/ln N(T*)`, `T* = 2 pi e^{2L}` --
though that law is MEASURED and its constant FITTED (Remark 1.5, Remark 12.2), not proved, and must
never be cited as a theorem.

Theorem 1.4 is scoped to certificates that bound the prime comb POINTWISE.  It is not a barrier for
positivity arguments in general, and escalating it to one misquotes the paper.
