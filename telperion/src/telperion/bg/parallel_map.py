"""Parallel island model + migration for empirical mapping of the tree landscape.

Gleaned from ARDA's island / mega-arena architecture (parallel populations with periodic migration).
Uses Python multiprocessing (ProcessPoolExecutor) for real across-core parallelism -- the practical
acceleration for empirical variable mapping, where the bottleneck is the NUMBER of trees/configs
evaluated (each rho evaluation is already linear-time via the cavity DP).

DESIGN NOTE on Rust / MLX.  Telperion is deliberately PURE PYTHON: the certificate generator is
untrusted by design, the Lean kernel is the sole trusted component, so the audit surface must stay
readable (see the project plan -- "no Rust").  A Rust NEON / MLX GPU kernel would contradict that
principle and belongs in the private research monorepo (a separate native build step), OUTSIDE the
trusted certificate path.  For tree-rho mapping this costs nothing: the per-evaluation work is linear
and the workload is embarrassingly parallel, so PROCESS-level parallelism delivers the scaling (one
core per island / per parameter cell) without a native dependency.  The `evaluator` hook below lets a
faster backend slot in behind the same interface if a genuine hot loop ever appears.

Two tools:
  * IslandModel  -- N MAP-Elites islands exploring the tree landscape in parallel, migrating elites
    between epochs (diverse move-offsets keep islands from collapsing to the same search).
  * parallel_sweep -- embarrassingly-parallel map of a picklable function over a parameter grid, for
    mapping rho-landscape variables (n, leg distributions, hub counts, ...) across all cores at once.
