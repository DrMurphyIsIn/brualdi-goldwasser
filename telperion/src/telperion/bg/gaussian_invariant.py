"""The Gaussian (Lewis-Riesenfeld) invariant construction -- and why it fails: smooth, not integral.

`sibling_coupling.py` reduced BG to a JOINT (multi-variable) sibling condition and pointed at a
Lewis-Riesenfeld Gaussian invariant: a quadratic form in the sibling state, conserved by the (mean-field)
recursion.  This module builds it and reports the outcome honestly.

THE SIBLING HESSIAN (the Gaussian form).  At the tie hub with children messages `mu_c` (tie: `j=5`,
`mu_c=1/3`, `S=5/3`), the hub energy is `x_hub = c0 - 11 log(1 + S/(j+1)) + sum_c x_c`.  Its Hessian in the
sibling-message coordinates splits as

    Hess x_hub  =  [ 11 (1/(j+1))^2 / (1+S/(j+1))^2 ] * J   +   diag(x_c'')
                =  (99/529) * J  (from the hub amplitude)   +   the children's self-curvature ,

where `J` is the all-ones matrix.  The amplitude part is RANK ONE: it curves ONLY the symmetric /
center-of-mass mode `S = sum mu_c` (the Lewis-Riesenfeld decoupled coordinate); the RELATIVE (asymmetric)
sibling modes get zero curvature from the hub.  So the Gaussian form is a rank-1 quadratic in the symmetric
mode -- exactly the near-star / `family_martingale` direction, and nothing transverse.

WHY THE GAUSSIAN INVARIANT CANNOT CERTIFY BG (the decisive obstruction).  A Gaussian/quadratic invariant is
SMOOTH, so it certifies the CONTINUOUS energy `x(s) = -log Phi^11(N(0,s))`, analytically continued in the
arm count `s`.  But the tie is NOT a smooth critical point: `x(5) = 0` yet `x'(5) ~ +0.0051 != 0`, so the
continuum DIPS BELOW ZERO near the tie -- its minimum is `x(s*) ~ -0.00046` at `s* ~ 4.82`, i.e.
`Phi^11 ~ 1.00046 > 1` on the continuum.  The bound `x >= 0` holds only because `s` is an INTEGER (the tie
is an arithmetic resonance); the smooth invariant would certify the overshooting continuum -- a FALSE
statement.  This is PROOF_STATUS dead-end #2 (smooth / archimedean vs. arithmetic) hit head-on.

THE UNIFYING VERDICT.  The two independent no-gos triangulate the TIER_B meta-target ("non-separable AND
integral"): the Lewis-Riesenfeld Gaussian supplies the NON-SEPARABLE (multi-variable quadratic) structure
but is SMOOTH, so it overshoots between integers; the 23-adic carrier (`resonance_carrier.py`) supplies the
INTEGRAL (arithmetic gap) structure but is SEPARABLE.  BG lives at their empty intersection, and neither
machinery alone reaches it.  A certifying invariant must be simultaneously multi-variable AND
integrality-aware -- a discrete/arithmetic Gaussian, which no standard framework supplies.
`conjecture1_proved = False`.
