"""The F <= h(mu) envelope: mapped; the TIGHT envelope h* is not inductive (a larger h can be -- see below).

`recursive_transfer.py` reduced BG to the per-vertex step `F_v = (64/621) a_v^11 prod_c F_c` and located
the crux at "dangerous" vertices.  The natural attempt to close it is an ENVELOPE: an explicit `h(mu)` with
`F_v <= h(mu_v)` that is INDUCTIVE (so `F_c <= h(mu_c)` for all children forces `F_v <= h(mu_v)`) and
`h <= 1` -- then BG follows by induction from the leaves (`F_leaf = 64/621 <= h(1)`).

WHAT THE ENVELOPE LOOKS LIKE.  The empirical envelope `h*(mu) = sup{ F : a vertex has message mu }` peaks at
EXACTLY 1 at the tie message `mu = 3/23` and is `< 1` everywhere else; the tie's own children are the
envelope extremizers at their messages (leaf: `mu=1, F=64/621`; arm/mid: `mu=1/3, F=486/529`) -- a
self-consistent spine.

WHY THE TIGHT ENVELOPE h* DOES NOT CLOSE IT (true, and checked here).  The induction step needs
`(64/621) a_v^11 prod_c h(mu_c) <= h(mu_v)` for every realizable `(a_v, {mu_c})`.  Tested with the TIGHT
envelope `h = h*`, this FAILS: thousands of actual vertices have `(64/621) a_v^11 prod_c h*(mu_c) > h*(mu_v)`
-- overshooting by up to ~100x -- because `prod_c h*(mu_c)` is not jointly realizable (distinct children
attain their per-message maxima on subtrees that cannot coexist as siblings).

CORRECTION (2026-09-29): SINGLE-VARIABLE ENVELOPES ARE *NOT* RULED OUT.  This module used to conclude, from
the failure of `h*`, that "a LARGER h only worsens the product" and hence that NO single-variable envelope
is inductive.  That step is invalid: a larger `h` also raises the right-hand side `h(mu_v)`, and the
tight envelope is not the only candidate.  An explicit counterexample to the old claim is a concave
piecewise-linear witness `U` (from unpublished work communicated by Professor John L. Goldwasser): in this
module's convention `h = exp(11 U)` (leaf `h(1) = 64/621`, `h(1/3) = 486/529`, `h(3/23) = 1`), and
`(64/621) a^11 prod_c h(mu_c) <= h(mu_v)` holds for EVERY child count, by Jensen at the mean message (U
concave).  Checked numerically for all child counts <= 3000 and on 52,369 real branches (no violation;
equality only at the leaf->cherry and cherry^5->A_5 ties).
So `mu_envelope_not_inductive` below certifies only that `h*` itself is not a supersolution.  It is not a
no-go for the per-message class, and it is not PROOF_STATUS dead-end #1.  `conjecture1_proved = False`.
