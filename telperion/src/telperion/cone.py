"""Exact cone membership: express a target in the nonnegative span of a basis.

The origin campaign searched for potential certificates by LP cutting-planes
over finite bases.  This is that maneuver's exactly-solvable core: given a
target polynomial/rational function and a basis of known-nonnegative
expressions, find rational λᵢ ≥ 0 with

    target ≡ Σ λᵢ · basisᵢ      (exact identity),

by matching monomial coefficients — an exact rational linear system.  A found
combination IS a certificate (each basis element nonneg, weights nonneg);
refusal is honest.

The OVERCOMPLETE (underdetermined) case — more basis elements than the monomial
equations pin down — is handled by exact basic-feasible-solution enumeration:
a nonnegative representation, if one exists, has a VERTEX form supported on at
most rank-many basis elements, so enumerating basis subsets and solving each
exactly finds it (the same sympy-only, SDP-free maneuver the Handelman finder
uses).  This closes the former "needs LP; named-open" gap without any numeric
solver — refusal now means genuine non-membership (a Farkas dual witnesses it),
not an undecided basis.
