"""Rigorous rational enclosures for the Route-P Bragg-floor certificate (bragg_floor backend).

conjecture1_proved = False.  This module does NOT prove RH.  It produces certified
rational data for a FINITE, Arb-enclosed numeric inequality of the shape

    (truncated log-prime Bragg amplitude, order n)  −  (certified tail)  ≥  (archimedean floor n)

where

  * the **archimedean floor** of order ``n`` is ``-(1 + Re taylorCoeff Γℝ n)`` — fully explicit
    (the polygamma-at-½ capstone ``taylorCoeff_Gammaℝ_polygamma``, #464); numerically
    ``taylorCoeff Γℝ n = (n+1)·a_{n+1}`` with ``a_j = [z^j] log Γℝ(1/(1−z))``,
    ``Γℝ(s) = π^{−s/2} Γ(s/2)`` — the SAME object the Li ladder's archimedean side uses, here
    validated against its closed-form trend ``(n/2)(log n + γ − 1 − log 2π)``;
  * the **log-prime (von Mangoldt / Bragg) amplitude** is read off the companion's log-derivative
    on ``Re s > 1`` (Brick D1, ``logDeriv_zetaPoleCompanion_eq_vonMangoldt``):
    ``logDeriv zetaPoleCompanion s = −Σ_m Λ(m) m^{−s} + (s−1)⁻¹`` — the Bragg comb supported on
    ``{log p^k}`` with amplitude ``Λ(p^k) = log p``.  We work at a fixed real base point ``s₀ > 1``
    (``BASE_S0``) where this series converges, truncate the comb to prime powers ``m ≤ N``, and
    bound the tail ``Σ_{m>N} Λ(m) m^{−s₀}`` rigorously from above.

HONESTY SEAM — WHAT THIS CERTIFIES AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
------------------------------------------------------
The certified object is ONLY the finite rational inequality above: a truncated Bragg partial sum
(with a certified tail slack) clears the explicit archimedean floor.  It is category-(b): finite,
Arb-checkable, consistent with RH, PROVING NOTHING about RH.

The connection from this finite Bragg datum to ``taylorCoeff zetaPoleCompanion n`` — and hence to
the Route-P falsifiability atom ``companion_below_floor_refutes_rh`` — runs ENTIRELY through the
CONDITIONAL reduction ``taylorCoeff_companion_bragg_of_exhaustion_limits`` (RvMCompanionBraggLimit),
whose ``T→∞`` exhaustion + archimedean-main-term-extraction hypotheses are the NAMED, UNBUILT,
RH-HARD frontier (the von Mangoldt series diverges at the Li base point ``s = 1``).  This module
NEITHER discharges NOR approaches those hypotheses; the emitter states them explicitly as the seam.

The Arb ball arithmetic (python-flint) is the documented non-kernel trust boundary, IDENTICAL to the
Li ladder (see ``li_coeff`` / ``rh_jensen.coefficients``): every ball rigorously encloses the true
value via directed-rounded radii read out exactly as ``fractions.Fraction`` via ``man_exp()``.

EXTERNAL ANCHOR (refuse-to-emit gate)
-------------------------------------
Before any box is handed out, the archimedean coefficients are self-checked against the published
Li–Keiper-adjacent trend and the von Mangoldt amplitudes against ``Λ(2),Λ(3),Λ(4) = log2,log3,log2``
— a normalization or index bug ABORTS here rather than emitting (mirrors ``li_coeff``'s published-
value anchor).

Dependency: python-flint (Arb/FLINT).  ``conjecture1_proved = False``.
