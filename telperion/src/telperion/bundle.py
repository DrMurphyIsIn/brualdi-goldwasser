"""Assemble many emitted certificate theorems into ONE Lean file, dedup'ing shared atoms.

The AXLE ``merge`` (+ ``merge_duplicates``) lesson: an emitter run per BG cell
produces one small Lean file each, and many cells reuse the SAME enclosure lemmas
(e.g. ``log54_sub_fstar_le`` is proved identically by several cells).  Emitting
each cell's file independently and then concatenating gives a Lean file that fails
to elaborate — the shared lemma is declared twice.  :func:`merge_bundle` collects
the theorem blocks from every source, keeps the FIRST occurrence of each name, and
drops later duplicates — but only when they are genuinely identical.  Two theorems
with the same NAME but DIFFERENT statements are a CONFLICT (an emitter bug or a
cell mismatch), and are surfaced loudly as ``ValueError`` rather than silently
merged.

Pure text: no Lean build is needed to parse/merge/stat.  The merged source can be
handed to :func:`telperion.verify.verify_lean` against a built environment to
kernel-check the whole assembled family in one pass.
