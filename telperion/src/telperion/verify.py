"""Structured Lean verification against a PERSISTENT pre-built environment.

Replaces the ad-hoc ``worktree add`` + ``lake exe cache get`` + ``lake build`` +
``grep 'Build completed'`` + separate ``#print axioms`` dance with ONE typed call:

    r = verify_lean(content, env_dir=Path("examples/log_combination/lean"),
                    decls=["log79_add_fstar"])
    assert r.okay and r.axioms_clean

The ``env_dir`` is a pre-built Lake project (its ``.lake`` already holds the
mathlib olean cache and any project deps), so verification ELABORATES the given
source against that environment via ``lake env lean`` WITHOUT re-fetching the
cache or rebuilding dependencies -- the "persistent environment" (cf. AXLE's
reusable ``environment``).  A warm long-lived Lean server for sub-second repeat
verification is available as an OPTIONAL, fallback-guarded fast path: pass a live
:class:`telperion.lean_server.LeanServer` via ``server=`` (see #5 below).

Trust model note: ``okay`` is the COMPILATION gate (no Lean errors AND a zero
subprocess exit code).  ``axioms_clean`` is the stronger TRUSTED gate -- every
CHECKED declaration's axiom set excludes ``sorryAx`` (and any axiom outside the
allow-list).  This mirrors AXLE's ``check`` (compile-only) vs ``verify_proof``
(rejects sorry/axioms) split, and Telperion's untrusted-generator /
trusted-kernel boundary.

Three hardening properties this module guarantees (previously bugs):

1. RETURNCODE BACKSTOP.  A nonzero ``lake env lean`` exit whose output carries no
   parseable ``:L:C: error:`` line no longer slips through as ``okay=True``.
   When ``returncode != 0`` and no error was parsed, a synthetic error is
   recorded and ``okay`` is forced ``False`` (same discipline as
   :mod:`telperion.evolve.kernel`, which gates on ``proc.returncode == 0``).

2. MULTI-LINE ERROR BLOCKS.  Lean diagnostics routinely span several lines
   (the goal state, the offending term, hints).  Errors are collected as the
   FULL block from a ``:L:C: error:`` header up to the next diagnostic header
   (``error:`` / ``warning:`` / ``info:`` at a ``:L:C:`` position) or EOF, not a
   single ``'error:'``-split line.

3. NON-VACUOUS ``axioms_clean``.  ``axioms_checked`` records whether ANY decl was
   actually axiom-checked.  When ``decls`` is empty nothing was certified, so
   ``axioms_clean`` is ``False`` -- callers must NAME what they certify.  A
   compile-only pass (no decls) is still expressible as ``r.okay`` alone.
