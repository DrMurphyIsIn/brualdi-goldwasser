"""Diagnosis: when certification refuses, say WHY and WHAT TO DO.

A refusal has exactly three possible causes, and confusing them wastes days
(the origin campaign's log is full of hours spent on each):

1. **The inequality is FALSE** — there is a rational counterexample.  No
   certificate shape will ever work; the family design (box, corners, claim)
   is wrong.  `find_counterexample` hunts for an exact witness.
2. **True but not Polya in this spelling** — the numerator has negative
   coefficients that a different decomposition might remove.  The remedy
   hints check the cheap transformations (positive factorization, box
   subdivision) and name the offending monomials.
3. **True and certifiable, tool misuse** — e.g. symbols missing
   `nonnegative=True`, wrong box axes.  The diagnosis reports what it sees.

Everything is exact rational arithmetic; a reported counterexample is a
theorem (the claim is false), never a float artifact.
