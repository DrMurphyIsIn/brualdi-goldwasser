"""Free-fermion / Green's-function toolkit for the tree matching problem.

The tree Laplacian matching model IS a free-fermion system (Kasteleyn; Godsil-Gutman: a forest's
matching polynomial equals the adjacency characteristic polynomial).  This module ports the verified
spectral structure -- the honest, grounded pieces, not open-ended physics.

Established / verified identities (see docs and the session record):

  1. Raw matching sum (GLOBAL free-fermion partition function).  For a tree,
        rho(T) = per(L)/prod(deg) = PROD_{lambda > 0 of N}(1 + lambda^2),   N = D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2},
     verified for all trees n <= 11.  The near-star N(0,s) has an (s-1)-fold degenerate mode at
     1/sqrt(2) (identical fermion modes = the arms) plus a mode at 1, giving rho = (4/3)(3/2)^s.

  2. Rooted branch Phi (LOCAL Green's function = the ACTUAL BG quantity).  The cavity recursion
     m_v = z/(1 + z sum_children m_c) is the Bethe-lattice continued-fraction Green's function
     (Abou-Chacra-Anderson-Thouless 1973).  It spectralizes as a benchmarked IMPURITY determinant:
        Phi^11(rooted at r) = (64/621)^n * det(H_r)^11 / (prod_v d'_v)^11,
        H_r = D + i A  (imaginary hopping),  D'_rr = deg(r)+1  (a virtual-parent impurity at r),
     verified exactly for all trees / all roots n <= 9.  BG's max-over-roots = the RESONANT IMPURITY
     site; the near-star hub is the optimal impurity; the tie (Phi=1) is a spectral resonance.

Spectra are floating-point (eigenvalues are irrational); the exact Phi lives in rooted_phi.py.  This
module is the spectral LENS on that exact object.
