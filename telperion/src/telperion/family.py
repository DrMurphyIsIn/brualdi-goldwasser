"""Family definitions: the user-facing description of an inequality family.

A family is a finite grid of instances.  Each instance is either a DIRECT claim
(``0 <= target``) over nonnegative real symbols, or a BILINEAR BOX claim
(``before <= after`` on a rectangle in two bound variables, reduced to four
corner certificates).  Everything downstream — certification, validation,
emission — consumes this one description.
