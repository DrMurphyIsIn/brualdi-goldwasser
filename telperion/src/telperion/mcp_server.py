"""The Telperion MCP server: the certify/validate/emit workflow as agent tools.

Run with:  telperion-mcp   (requires `pip install "telperion[mcp]"`)

Register in Claude Code:
  claude mcp add telperion -- telperion-mcp

Tools mirror the enforced workflow — there is no emit tool that skips
certification or validation.  `certify_family`/`emit_family` import the family
module the caller names: point this server only at projects you trust, exactly
as you would an editor or test runner.

The transcendental-free rule holds: every tool answers from exact arithmetic;
nothing here trusts floats or asserts truth — the Lean kernel downstream does.
