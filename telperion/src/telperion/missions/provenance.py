"""Provenance: who wrote a statement, who read it back, and what the gate actually saw.

WHY (governance 2026-09-23, docs/AUDIT_INDEPENDENCE_2026-09-23.md). The read-back is the
one link in the proof chain no machine checks: it is the testimony that the formal statement
says what its title claims. `MISSIONS_DESIGN_2026-09-11.md` section 8 required the renderer
to be independent of the author, but nothing recorded who the author was, `--auditor` was
free text, and every testimony written 2026-09-19..22 came from a subagent of the authoring
session under the same git identity. The proofs themselves are fine; the point of this
module is to make self-certification VISIBLE and refuse it where it can be recognised.

Three records, all small and all in the node file:

  [author]     identity + session + date, written by `mission add`;
  [readback]   gains auditor_identity / auditor_session / independence, written by
               `mission audit`, which REFUSES an auditor matching the author;
  [grant]      artifact + statement digests, gate version, identity, session, date --
               written by the gate only; `mission verify` recomputes the digests.

Plus a `[comparator]` sidecar recording a passing independent-judge run (deliverable 2).

None of this is unforgeable. A session can supply any identity string for itself or for a
subagent. What it buys is a record the next reader can check against git and against the
attempts ledger, and a CLI that will not write a self-audit without being lied to.
