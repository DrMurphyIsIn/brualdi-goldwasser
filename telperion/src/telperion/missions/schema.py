"""Missions registry schema: one small file per node/manifest/claim.

TOML I/O is a CLOSED LOOP: `dumps_toml` emits a restricted, deterministic
subset (sorted keys; str/int/bool, lists of strings, one level of nested
tables), and `loads_toml` reads via stdlib tomllib when available (Python
3.11+, the CI environment — repo convention, see status.py) with an
in-module fallback parser that accepts exactly what `dumps_toml` emits.
Round-trip is tested; hand-written files are read by tomllib in CI.

      * `name  =  "RH.foo"` (extra spaces) -> key `'name '`, so the field vanishes;
      * `proof.via = "direct"` (dotted key) -> a top-level key, so the proof is absent;

    `tomli` is the same parser as `tomllib`, so preferring it on older interpreters removes

    """Write `text` to `path` so a concurrent reader sees either the old file or the new one.

    WHY (audit 2026-09-19). Every writer here was a bare `write_text`, which truncates in
    place. Under two concurrent writers and two readers, 1325 of 8000 reads saw an EMPTY
    file and 399 saw torn TOML. Most torn reads fail loudly -- but not all: an exhaustive
    byte-prefix scan of all 66 live node files found 201 truncation points that load as a
    VALID `Node` with a field silently missing, `readback` among them in 64 of the 66 files.

    That is the dangerous shape, because `_load_and_save` reads, replaces one field, and
    writes back. A session that reads a torn file mid-write and saves it PERMANENTLY erases
    the read-back -- the record that gates `promote_to_open` -- with no error anywhere.

    `os.replace` is atomic on POSIX and Windows, so a reader never observes a partial file.
