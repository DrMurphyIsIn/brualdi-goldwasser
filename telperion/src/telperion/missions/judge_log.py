"""Read the independent judge's verdict out of a CI job log.

`mission comparator-record` used to take the run id, the theorem name and the kernel mode
on trust: it wrote whatever string it was handed, and nothing checked that the cited run
had actually passed on that node, let alone with that theorem.  The convention ("the island
theorem's fully-qualified name, exactly as the PASS line prints it") lived only in reviewers'
heads.  These functions turn it into a check.

The judge prints one line per node:

    COMPARATOR PASS island=rvm_bridge node=<slug> theorem=<thm> run=<id> kernel=<mode>

with `kernel` either `nanoda` (both kernels replayed the export) or `lean-kernel-only` (the
node declares `heavy_certificates = true`, so only the Lean kernel and the axiom whitelist
ran).  A failure prints `::error::COMPARATOR FAIL island=... node=... theorem=...`.

Two details matter when reading a log:

* The job log also contains the workflow's own `echo` of those templates, with the shell
  variables unexpanded (`node=$slug`).  Those are not verdicts and are skipped.
* Verdicts must be read from the JOB, never from the run's conclusion.  Pushing the record
  commit to the same pull request supersedes the run that validated the artifact, so the
  run's overall conclusion can be `cancelled` while the shard that judged this node passed
  (seen 2026-09-25 on cl/kwin: run 36169770951 cancelled, job 108204239961 successful).
