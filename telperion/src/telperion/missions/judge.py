"""Independent judge for the missions registry: Comparator challenges from registered statements.

WHAT THIS IS. For every PROVED node whose Lean artifact lives on an example island, emit an
openai/ten-proofs Comparator (github.com/leanprover/comparator) challenge whose statement is
the node's REGISTERED statement and whose proof is the artifact's theorem:

    -- MissionChallenges/<Slug>.lean, generated from the registry
    import <artifact module>            -- the solution
    import <island AxiomGuard modules>  -- the whole island (see "shadowing" below)
    <the statement file's `open` lines>
    theorem MissionJudge.<Slug> : forall <binders>, <conclusion> := <artifact theorem>

`<binders>` and `<conclusion>` are the registered statement's own text (the file under
`missions/<campaign>/lean/Statements/`, header hash intact), split at its top-level colon;
nothing else is written by hand. The Comparator config then asserts `MissionJudge.<Slug>`
with permitted axioms [propext, Quot.sound, Classical.choice] and nanoda on.

WHAT THE JUDGE THEN ESTABLISHES, on a machine and in a program the author did not write:
  1. statement identity -- the bridge theorem's TYPE is the registered statement, and its
     proof term is the artifact constant; the Lean kernel and nanoda accept that term only if
     the artifact's type is definitionally the registered statement. A weaker theorem
     (`P ∨ True`), a different constant, or a wrong vocabulary does not type-check;
  2. axiom whitelist -- checked on the export, so `sorryAx`, `ofReduceBool` (native_decide)
     and a smuggled `axiom` anywhere in the proof's closure are refused;
  3. two kernels -- the export is replayed through Lean's kernel AND nanoda (Rust).
What it does NOT do: read the title. Whether the formal statement says what its title claims
is still the read-back's job. And it resolves the statement's names in the ARTIFACT'S
environment, not the campaign's vocabulary mirror (`Statements.RHDefs` etc.), because the
Comparator needs one Lake workspace; mirror fidelity is missions/mirrors.py's check.

WHY A BRIDGE THEOREM AND NOT COMPARATOR'S OWN "same name, same type" MODE. That mode needs
the challenge to declare the theorem under the artifact's name WITHOUT importing the
artifact, so the challenge can only import the artifact's imports. On dbn that works (the
vocabulary lives in DBNDefs); on rvm_bridge 28 of 52 statements use definitions declared in
the artifact module itself (`RvMBridge14.effectiveThreshold` in E6Bridge14), so the literal
challenge does not elaborate. The bridge form elaborates everywhere and is checked by the
same two kernels; the identity it certifies is definitional rather than syntactic, which is
the right notion for "proves the registered proposition".

SHADOWING. An artifact that avoided importing the island's vocabulary module and declared its
own `DBN.H` would make the registered statement resolve to the impostor. The challenge
therefore also imports the island's AxiomGuard modules (which import every island module):
a constant declared twice on the island is a duplicate-declaration error, so the challenge
fails to build and the judge fails.
On an island with no AxiomGuard lean_lib (bg: the R3Cert package, whose AxiomGuard.lean is a
loose file and whose full library includes R47PC6Cells, ~70 min / 18 GB that no node needs)
the challenge instead imports the island modules its campaign's vocabulary mirror cites as
the source of each copied block (`-- ===== ExactCruxes.lean:70 =====` in BGDefs.lean). That
catches an artifact re-declaring a mirrored vocabulary constant; it does NOT catch a
shadowed constant that is not in the mirror (the whole-island import would).

OUT-OF-TREE ISLANDS (`OUT_OF_TREE_ISLANDS`): bg lives at proof/formalization, not
telperion/examples/<island>/lean. Its proved nodes are the registry nodes whose [proof]
artifact lies under that directory; everything else is the same.

NOT CONSUMABLE (reported, never skipped silently): a statement that declares anything besides
its final theorem (local `def`s would collide with the artifact's copies; 2 of 97 nodes,
both on islands outside the CI matrix), an island whose toolchain has no Comparator tag, or
an island whose package cannot be path-required (zeta_zero_localization's monolith lakefile).

Output layout (`--out`, default `telperion/missions/judge/<island>/`):
  lean-toolchain                       copy of the island's
  lakefile.toml                        path-requires the island; one lib `MissionChallenges`
  MissionChallenges.lean               root import of every challenge
  MissionChallenges/<Slug>.lean        the challenge (bridge) module
  <Slug>.comparator.json               the Comparator config
  MANIFEST.json                        node -> (campaign, theorem, solution module, digests)
