"""Verify gate: invariant battery, proved/refuted status flip, closure fixpoint.

This module is the SOLE path through which a node's status becomes `proved` or
`refuted`. Every other mutator (set_proof, promote_to_open, deprecate) is
explicitly prohibited from making that flip.

Key functions:
  normalize_lean      -- strip comments, collapse whitespace, drop trailing sorry
  statement_matches   -- normalized containment check (artifact contains statement)
  refutation_matches  -- containment of refutation_statement (or ¬ + proposition)
  _compute_closures   -- pure fixpoint over reduction-proved nodes; no I/O
  recompute_closures  -- _compute_closures + write-back to disk (used by grant_status)
  grant_status        -- the gate: flip open -> proved/refuted, raise GateError on fail
  verify_campaign     -- full invariant battery (read-only); returns VerifyReport
