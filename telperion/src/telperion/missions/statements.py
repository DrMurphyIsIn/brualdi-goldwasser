"""Statement file management: render, write, provenance, package scaffold.

Files are written under <root>/lean/Statements/<Slug>.lean.
Every file carries a provenance header that encodes a sha256 of the
normalized post-header body + node slug + manifest env.  regen_diff
detects hand edits by re-deriving that hash from the on-disk post-header
content and comparing it to the value stored in the header.

Root import (added 2026-09-24).  A statement module is only ELABORATED by CI if the
package root `<root>/lean/Statements.lean` imports it: the `mission-statements-compile`
job runs `lake build` on the default target, and lake builds exactly the root's import
closure.  Fifteen registered modules (eleven rh, four mirrormere, several of them
`status = "proved"`) had been written by `write_statement` and never added to the
root, so the design invariant "a statement that does not elaborate cannot enter the
graph" was not enforced for them; one (`MM_weil_positivity_window_tenth`) had no
`import` line at all.  `write_statement` therefore now also appends the module to
the root (`ensure_root_import`), and `verify_campaign` fails on any module the root
does not import (`missing_root_imports`) or any statement without an import header
(`import_header_error`).
