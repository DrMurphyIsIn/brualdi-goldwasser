"""Li positivity-ladder emitter — the RH-roadmap Track-2 showcase.

Li's criterion (Xian-Jin Li 1997), formalized upstream in
`nicholasbulka/li-criterion-rh-equivalence-lean` as

    LiCriterion.li_criterion_rh_iff :
      RiemannHypothesis ↔ (∀ n : ℕ, 0 ≤ (taylorCoeff riemannXi n).re)

i.e. RH ⟺ every Li–Keiper coefficient of the Riemann ξ has nonnegative real
part.  This emitter certifies a FINITE PREFIX of that ladder: for a chosen `n`,
`0 ≤ (taylorCoeff riemannXi n).re` — the n-th rung — from a rigorous positive
rational lower bound on the coefficient.

HONESTY SEAM (identical discipline to RH-in-a-box / the effective dVP region): the
lower bound `lo ≤ (taylorCoeff riemannXi n).re` is an EXTERNAL numeric input (Arb /
mpmath interval arithmetic on ξ's Taylor coefficient at 0), carried as the theorem
HYPOTHESIS `hlo`.  The kernel proves only the trivial `0 ≤ lo ⟹ 0 ≤ coeff` step;
it does NOT evaluate the transcendental coefficient.  Certifying the n-th rung is
NOT progress toward RH: the uniform `∀ n` is exactly `li_criterion_rh_iff`'s RHS,
which IS RH.  `conjecture1_proved = False`.

Emitted per rung (`import`s the upstream `LiCriterion` library for `riemannXi` /
`taylorCoeff` — CI-wired via the lakefile `require`, see LI_POSITIVITY_LADDER.md):

    theorem <name> (hlo : (lo : ℝ) ≤ (taylorCoeff riemannXi n).re) :
        0 ≤ (taylorCoeff riemannXi n).re :=
      le_trans (by norm_num : (0:ℝ) ≤ lo) hlo

The claim is load-bearing (about the ACTUAL ξ coefficient, not an abstract real);
`hlo` is the documented trust boundary.
