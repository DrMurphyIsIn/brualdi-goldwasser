"""Symbolic certification: the gate between a family definition and emission.

certify() proves, in sympy over exact rationals, that every instance of the
family carries a Polya certificate (all-nonnegative-coefficient numerator over
a factored positive denominator), and — for bilinear families — that the
declared before/after difference IS the bilinear form of its four corner
certificates.  Nothing can be emitted without the CertifiedFamily witness this
function returns; a failure raises CertificationError naming every failing
(grid point, corner).

Trust note: none of this is trusted.  The Lean kernel re-proves every emitted
claim from scratch; these checks exist to catch errors before a CI round-trip,
not to establish truth.
