"""Tie-variety extraction and margin reports: WHERE is the family tight?

For a mathematician the equality cases are the theorem — the extremal
structure lives exactly where the inequality degenerates.  This module answers
"where is this family tight, and by how much elsewhere?" exactly.

The certified/refused dichotomy does the heavy lifting:

* A CERTIFIED instance has an all-nonnegative-coefficient numerator, so on the
  closed orthant ``num = 0`` iff every monomial vanishes — the tie variety is
  a finite union of coordinate faces ``{x_i = 0 : i in H}`` over the MINIMAL
  HITTING SETS ``H`` of the monomial supports.  Purely combinatorial, exact.
  Corollary: certified instances have NO interior ties (an interior zero of a
  nonneg-coefficient polynomial forces it to vanish identically) — which is
  precisely why interior-tie claims (the campaign's Φ = 1 tie variety) admit
  no Polya certificate and need the arithmetic treatment.

* A refused-but-true claim gets exact root extraction instead: univariate
  numerators via ``real_roots`` (exact algebraic numbers, filtered to the
  orthant), multivariate via ``solve`` where sympy can.

Margins are exact rationals: the numerator's constant term is a global orthant
floor for ``num``; the empirical minimum is an exact evaluation over a
deterministic dyadic + seeded-random sample (a bound witness, not a proof of
the minimum).
