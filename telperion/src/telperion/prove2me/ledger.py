"""Append-only jsonl record of every prove2.me attempt (spec section 5).

Same convention as telperion.ledger.RouteLedger (dead ends as durable data),
but jsonl and keyed for the bridge's three consumers: triage ranking
(win_rate), the no-repeat rule (attempted/rejected), and `p2m status`.
This record shape deliberately seeds sub-project A's mission registry.

Verdict taxonomy
----------------
Wins (scored + count as attempted):
  Proved         — server accepted; kernel verified
  Disproved      — negation certificate accepted

Losses (scored + count as attempted):
  Rejected       — server rejected; re-triage
  BuildFailed    — local lake build failed; never submitted
  CertifyRefused — I2/I3 invariant blocked; never submitted

Unscored (count as attempted for no-repeat; EXCLUDED from win_rate):
  SubmittedUnknown — verify() succeeded but verdict poll raised before resolving
  PollTimeout      — poll budget exhausted; submission may still be processing

Not attempted (never counts as attempted or in win_rate):
  DryRun           — --no-submit; nothing sent to the platform
